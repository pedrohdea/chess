The dataset includes 59 images.
Piece are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
